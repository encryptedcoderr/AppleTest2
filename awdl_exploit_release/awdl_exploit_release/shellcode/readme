an extremely hacky three-stage raw shellcode loader for iOS

the build* python scripts generate the three shellcode stubs;
you'll need to ensure that their output is in the right place and format

this needs to run on a MacOS system with the XCode iOS toolchain installed

the scripts are, err, pretty hacky ;-)

they will not fail gracefully if any of the (undocumented) prerequisites are broken :-)

don't add anything which causes global variable allocation, imports symbols or causes
new segments or sections to be allocated!

but it does work and you can still do whatever you want within these constraints

see the existing shellcode sample for inspiration
