# This workflow performs internal reconnaissance of the AWDL/AirDrop stack on macOS.
# It identifies the awdl0 interface, finds all related daemons (including airportd
# and wifip2pd), actively stimulates AWDL activity, and then uses powerful system
# tracing and packet capture tools to monitor and log all interactions.
